Common:
    This form is created for testing web-resources.
    By this form you can make POST/GET http-request with parameters
    to any http:\\domain\action_script.
    It created by html + js, using JQuery framework.

How it work:
    In first step you must load html file by browser,
    then fill fields and press send-button.
    When send-button was pressed, jscript create new form,
    add parameters to form, switch POST/GET method and add action script.
    In the end of form creation, form will submit and make http-request.
    
    For easy tool using is a get uqery string field,
    you can copy URL from browser to this field and action script 
    and varible fields will auto fill. Then you must customize form
    and press submit.
